This is a k-ary attributes dataset with 300 abstract objects. I have a hidden item in mind.
Ask questions about one attribute at a time from this list:
color, shape, material, size, pattern, origin, use_case, energy.
The answer will be a single value for that attribute, for example "red" or "triangle".
After each answer, show your current belief over remaining items and how many candidates are left.
If you can estimate entropy mentally, include it. Do not run code or use tools.
Stop when only one candidate remains, or when multiple items have an identical attribute vector and cannot be separated.
