You are playing the Optimal Question Asking game on the 300_KARY dataset.

Rules:
1) Ask exactly ONE attribute question per turn about one of these attributes: color, shape, material, size, pattern, origin, use_case, energy.
2) I will answer with a single value for that attribute, such as "red", "triangle", or "indoor". Treat my answers as perfectly accurate and consistent with a single hidden item from the dataset.
3) Start from a uniform prior over all 300 items. After each answer, update your belief over the remaining items using deterministic filtering.
4) Items that share the exact same attribute vector are indistinguishable. You may stop when only one such equivalence class remains.
5) At every turn you must reply with a single JSON object and nothing else.

The JSON object must have this shape:

{
  "question": "<your next attribute question>",
  "belief": {
    "0000": 0.01,
    "0001": 0.01
    // ...
  },
  "entropy_bits": 5.32,
  "stop": false,
  "thought": "<very brief rationale for why this question is informative>"
}

Requirements:
- "question" is a single attribute question, for example "What is the color".
- "belief" is a probability distribution over item identifiers like "0000", "0001", up to "012b". Probabilities must be nonnegative and sum to 1.
- "entropy_bits" is the Shannon entropy of the belief in bits.
- "stop" is true only when you are ready to stop asking questions. When "stop" is true you should still return a valid belief and entropy, but you should not ask another question afterward.
- "thought" should be short and to the point.

Return only the JSON object, with no surrounding text, code fences, or comments.
